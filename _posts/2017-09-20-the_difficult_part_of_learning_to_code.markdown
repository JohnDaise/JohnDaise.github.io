Writing Tic Tac Toe from scratch in Ruby has been fairly challenging. I think the most challenging part is that I have been grossly overthinking the solutions to the errors that I receive. I have been so used to using software from the other end that I overestimate certain functions. 

I have also found Ruby to be a very forgiving language. I found that there a multiple ways to solve similar problems. Even ways that are completely inefficient are still deemed acceptable. This leads me to my next focus in my learning. I feel a challenge to make more elegant code. After going back through previous methods, I realized that I could have written some of my code in a much more succinct manner. This matters because more succinct code makes for faster runtime/more efficiency.

This realization that I have been overthinking and wanting to write more efficient code has led me to reflect a lot on the *Single Responsibilty Principle*.

This priniciple states "that every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class."

This principle makes complete sense and thinking about this has pushed me to think differently about my approach to coding and separating out responsibilities of certain blocks to simpler methods. 

Programming a version of Tic Tac Toe has given me a new found appreciation for the software programs that we commonly use everyday.
