Just as I have begun learning HTML and CSS, I have been tasked with creating my first business website. A family member of mine, who has an educational consulting business, has asked me to design and create a website for her. 

This is the perfect challenge because 1) I will need to build a practical website that provides basic information and 2) I will need to design the website in a way that is visually appealing and simple to use for potential customers.

This seemed like a simple proposition for her, but I tried my best to explain that much more would need to go into creating the site. I will have a meeting with her to go into more detail of what she would like her website to convey in both concrete and abstract terms.

Here are a few websites from similar businesses that I am using as references to share with my "client":
