Hello. My name is John. I am a teacher and in my free time I enjoy playing music. I have had very little exposure to computer programming. I remember learning some of the basics of HTML in computer class in middle school and in college I took an Introductory Computer Science course which was basically for people who needed a science/math credit but didn't want to go too deep into the subject matter. I actually ended up majoring in East Asian Studies with a focus on Chinese language and culture. So the question is...

Why am I learning to code??

One reason why I want to code goes back my interest in language. One thing that I really appreciated about my East Asian Studies degree is that after I graduated, I felt my worldview had grown immensely. There was a whole other population of people that I could now better understand and communicate with. I feel the same way about coding. Even though with computer programming I would essentially be learning how to talk to a computer, I feel that when I get further along, my world will open up and I would be able to communicate with a larger community of people. The ability to code is a skill set that I see as being incredibly useful in multiple arenas, whether it's in a professional setting or in my personal life. 

Why did I decide to code now?

One thing about being a teacher is that educators tend to have what is called a "growth mindset." Educators for the most part believe that anyone can learn anything as long as that person has the right attitude and is intellectually curious. Being in this frame of mind for my students has caused me to reflect on my own personal/professional pursuits. I believe I can become a computer progammer.
